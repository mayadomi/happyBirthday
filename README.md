# Happy Cakeday
Learning JavaScript through building a surprise game for my colleague.
Based on Phaser (https://phaser.io/)

## Play
Head over to https://mayadomi.github.io/happyBirthday/ to start playing.

Aim of the game is to collect all the candles for the cake - but watch out, where there are candles, there may be fire....

Hopefully the instructions are self-explanatory, if not:
- Up key -> jump
- Left key -> move left
- Right key -> move right
- Down key -> no effect

## Things I learnt
Didn't mean to inclde phaser.min.js in the repo, but it's there now... maybe will update/fix later :)

Sprites are a whole thing of design, had fun working it all out. 

Understanding scenes and moving from one to the next.

Grasping the layout concepts, where 0,0 is and how to place elements.

How to call JS files from HTML.

Game design is fun :D
